/**Task 6
Task: Odd or even?



Write a Javascript program that checks if a given number, number is odd or even. 
If the number is odd, print to the console: number is odd. If  the number is even, print to the console: number is even 

Hint: An even number is divisible by 2. Hence, for an even number, the expression, 

number % 2 === 0 will evaluate to true



Steps

Initialize a variable, number and assign it any number of your choice.

Write an if statement check if number is divisible by 2 (HINT: use the modulus operator)

Log the string number is even to the console if the number is divisible by 2

Add an else block

Inside the else block, log number is even to the console

You can test your code by assigning different values to the number variable in step 1 

 */


const number = 33;

//check if the number is even
if(number % 2 == 0) {
    console.log("The number is even.");
}
// if the number is odd
else {
    console.log("The number is odd.");
}
